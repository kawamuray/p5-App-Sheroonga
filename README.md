# ABOUT
## What is this?
High functional [Groonga](http://groonga.org) shell client.
The original Groonga shell client which distributed with Groonga itself
is very poor.  The result of command output is very hard to read, very few
keyboard support(i.e. there is no Crtl-H(backward delete)), no history
and no completion.

This project aims to provide the shell which supports these features.

## Product state
### Code
Still on development, so it is alpha quality and any non-compatible changes
